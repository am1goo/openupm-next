# Reclaiming Package Ownership

You can reclaim package ownership in the following cases:

- If you are the package owner and wish to publish your content on OpenUPM but find that the name is already taken by a forked repository, simply send us a pull request to update the existing package metadata YAML file, directing it to your repository. Additionally, leave a message for us to review.

- If you want to take over an abandoned package to continue maintaining it under the original name, we recommend forking it and modifying it with a new name. We've seen cases where the original author changed their mind and resumed work on a long-idle project. However, if the existing abandoned package is merely a forked repository with minimal UPM support, you can take over by sending us a pull request to update the existing package metadata YAML file, pointing it to your repository.
